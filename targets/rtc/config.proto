// TargetsConf represents listing targets from a key/val set stored in the RTC
// API under a certain provided configuration. It always only lists the keys
// (hostnames) and provides a resolver which will resolve to a single tag. This
// can be used as a kind of drop-in replacement for GCE Instances when that
// would not be possible. For example, one could set "resolve_tag" to "ip", and
// this lister will now list all VM names, with a resolver that resolves those
// names to their ip addresses.
//
// For more information on RTC see
// https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/runtime-configurator/reference/rest/
//
// It is assumed that this is being curated, and indeed can be controlled with
// settings in a cloudprober configuration.  See
// cloudprober/config/config.proto.
